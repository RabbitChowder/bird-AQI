I am observing from inside, so I can only really hear birds that are close or really loud. I used binoculars to see birds from further away, but that means I may have missed something while I was looking through them. There were some American Crows in the distant trees, but I did not count them because they did not come into my backyard/feeder site"

There was a squirrel in the feeder site today. There was less seed on the ground and on our deck today, and the snow seemed to cover most of the rest up that was left over from a couple days ago"

There is a new bird feeder in my backyard that is slightly out of my line of vision from the window I have been looking out of for the rest of these session. There were also a lot of squirrels at the site today. My dad came home from walking our dog towards the beginning of this session, so that might have scared some of the birds away from our house."
